# Vue Pokedex

A recreation of my [React Pokedex]("https://github.com/chrisstanarsenault/projectAWeek-Pokedex") built in Vue to practice using Vue again. Styling is done using TailwindCSS.

Vue version is missing some of the polished features and styling that are in the React version, as this was more a simple app to understand and learn how to do React things the Vue way.
